# Apiary Blueprint Highlighter for Atom

This plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io) editor provides syntax highlighting for [Apiary](https://apiary.io) Blueprint language.

Since the syntax of the Apiary Blueprint is really simple, it's enough to highlight only lines starting with `#` or `+` (`-`, `*`).
